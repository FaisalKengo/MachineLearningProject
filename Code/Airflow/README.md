This is a tracker made with Airflow to recap all the CS:GO professional match results. The initial dataset was taken from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrieltardochi/counter-strike-global-offensive-matches) and can be further updated if there are any updated scrapping from hltv.org where the initial dataset came from.
